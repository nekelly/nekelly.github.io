### Mystery Of The Origin of Life 

- Abiogenesis (where did life come from? evolution does not explain the origins of life)
- Probability problem (The massive improbability of proteins forming by chance, panspermia theory)
- The complexity of the cell
- Irreducible complexity
- The prebiotic materials problem
- Problems with evolution (micro vs macro evolution, Cambrian explosion, no smooth transitions found in fossil records)
