### Mystery Of The Origin of Life 
&nbsp;

##### Abiogenesis
Abiogenesis, as distinct from evolution, is the study of how the first simple living things were assembled from simpler prebiotic
molecules. Evolution comes after abiogenesis because you have to have something living in order for it
to evolve. Evolution could be said to explain the <i>survival</i> of the fittest but not the <i>arrival</i> of the fittest.

Initially it was assumed that life arose on earth through natural means. It was thought that some kind of primordial "soup"
combined with UV rays, lightning, heat etc could explain how basic molecules assmembled into complex cells which at the molecular
level are actually incredibly complex "factories". When Charles Darwin formulated his famous theory of evolution, it was thought that cells were 
merely "blobs" of organic matter, not the complex structures we know them to be since the invention of powerful microscopes. 

Following on from the discovery of the structure of DNA by Crick and Watson, scientists discovered that the molecules that form the "ladder" between the 
double helices, form apparently random patterns. The molecules involved are adenine, cytosine, thymine, and guanine, (abbreviated as A,C,T,G). It was 
later disovered that the order of these molecules isn't random at all but in fact is a code or "blueprint" for building proteins in a cellular factory.

Where the abiogenesis theory runs into difficulty is in the high <i>specificity</i> of the proteins i.e. their structure is highly unlikely to occur randomly.
These proteins are very specific in the sense that if they don't have a precise specified molecular ordering and three-dimensional structure, then the 
structure can perform no useful function. Let's take as an example a short protein (150 molecules) and keep in mind that hundreds of different protein 
types are required to make a functional cell. The factors involved in the specificity could be summarized as follows:

1. The molecular chain is composed of amino acids
2. The bonds between neighbouring molecules must be a peptide bond. Peptide and non-peptide bonds are equally likely so the probability so the probability
is 0.5 for each bond. When you multiply 0.5 by itself 150 times, the probability becomes extremely small (7 x 10^-46)
3. In addition to having peptide-only bonds, amnio acids are left-handed and right-handed. In the double helix, one side of the ladder must contain all
left-handed acids and the other, all right-handed acids. Again the probability is 0.5 for each bond and the overall probablity is 7 * 10^-46.
4. The next level of specificity is the sequence of A,C,T,G. If these don't occur, you end up with a protein that does nothing, it has no function. 
The probability of the amino acids bonding in the correct sequence is 0.25^150 = 4 * 10^-91
5. The above specific conditions must occur on both sides of the double helix.
6. Approximately 200 specific proteins types are required to build a functioning cell.
7. Proteins are required to build DNA and DNA is required to build proteins so we have a chicken and egg situation.
8. A cell is the minimum viable living organism e.g the single-cell amoeba. All the parts of the cell need to be in place or the cell cannot survive.
 
For anyone who is familiar with the CAD/CAM process used in manufacturing, the design is done on a computer and the instructions are sent to a CNC 
machine to which creates the component. The way DNA is used to build new proteins is a very similar process. The sequence of A,C,T,G pieces is exactly 
like a computer program i.e. a set of instructions used to carry out the task of building new proteins.  


##### Irreducible complexity
(TODO - some notes about how all parts of the mechanism need to be in place for the whole mechanism to function)

##### The prebiotic materials problem
(Todo - Not all prebiotic molecules occur naturally)
##### Problems with evolution 
(micro vs macro evolution, Cambrian explosion, no smooth transitions found in fossil records)
