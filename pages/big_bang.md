### The Big Bang

The universe began to exist 13.8 billion years ago. To speak of a time "before" the big-bang is meaningless becase
time itself began with the big bang. Also space didn't exist. There was literally **nothing**

Therefore whatever caused the big-bang is timeless, spaceless and immensely powerful.
