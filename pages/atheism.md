### Atheism

- Assumes naturalism
- Can be shown to be inconsistent and self-defeating

Christian apologist Francis Schaeffer (1912-1984) wrote a brilliant critique of Western philosophical thought entitled Escape from 
Reason (1968). He suggested that philosophers tend to live in a "two storey" world. The lower storey is the level of normal existence, 
consistent with what they profess to believe to be true. It is a world without ultimate purpose or meaning. Mankind, Schaeffer claims, 
cannot live happily on this level, and so these philosophers repeatedly leap to the upper storey in which there is meaning, value and 
purpose. The atheist has no right to make this leap, but he cannot help himself because we have an innate need to find meaning and 
purpose. Schaeffer suggests that this need is a powerful indicator that our lives have ultimate meaning and that this is because we 
were created for a purpose by God.
