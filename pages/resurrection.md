### The Resurrection Of Jesus
&nbsp;

The resurrection of Jesus is considered by Christians to be an historical event and is the cornerstone on which Christianity either stands or falls.
St Paul put it like this in his letter to the Corinthians - <i>"And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith is useless and you are still guilty 
of your sins."</i>

God in his infinite wisdom knows that people need proof for supernatural claims. It would be very foolish of us to accept every claim that comes our way.
Jesus way of proving that He was the Son of God was through miracles, the turning of water into wine, healing the deaf, dumb, blind, and lame. Jesus' ultimate
miracle was His resurrection. 

But what is resurrection? Is it different from near-death experiences or reincarnation? The gospels record the story of Lazarus whom Jesus brought back from 
the dead. But according to scripture, the resurrection of Jesus was different from coming back to life because it involved a transformation of the body into 
what theologians call a "glorified" body. We learn from the gospels that Jesus was able to appear and disappear at will because He appeared to his apostles
who were hiding is a locked room. After He has spoken to them, He disappeared just as he had arrived.

So what evidence do we have that the resurrection is an historical event? The argument I will present here is based on the work of people such as Gary Habermas, 
Michael Licona and William Lane Craig.

1. On the third day, after Jesus crucifixion, His tomb was found empty.
Considering the Jewish Sanhedrin were attempting the stamp out the rise of Christianity, it was in their interest to make sure Jesus's disciple didn't steal
the body and then claim that Jesus rose from the dead and disappeared up to heaven. In any case, the apostles didn't even know the resurrection was going to
so it wouldn't make sense for them to steal the body. After the crucifixion, they thought they had backed the wrong horse, so to speak, that Jesus had let
them down. There is also the claim that the tomb was guarded by Roman soldiers to deal with.
