### About
&nbsp;

The purpose of this site is to attempt to show that belief in God
is not necessarily a matter of blind faith, as most of us have been often told. Rather, belief in a Supreme Being
is not only rational, but is the only way to make sense of the world we live in. Science by its very nature is 
constrained to observe nothing but natural phenomema. While this approach is understandable from a scientific point of view, 
it is ultimately self-defeating. My personal belief is that fundamental science has just about pushed the boundaries of science
as far at they can go and has such, has hit a "glass ceiling". This is propably most evident in the fields of particle physics
and cosmology where scientist are desperately trying to solve the problem of the origin of the universe and to unite
General Relativity and Quantum Physics. While the scientific observations corroborate General Theory and provide ample evidence
that the universe began to exist 13.8 billion years ago, the idea of a beginning from nothing is abhorrent to a large part of
the scientific community, who prefer eternal models of the universe in which there was no beginning.

The second claim that I make here is that the world's various religions are fundamentally incompatible becuase they make
mutually-exclusive, contradictory claims. It is therefore logical to conclude that either, all religions are false or that one
and only one is true. For a religion to be true, it must be revealed by God since we cannot know God directly expect by God's
self-revelation. My claim is that Jesus is God's definitive self-revelation since Jesus was and is God-made-man i.e. one person
with a divine and a human nature.

My contention is that God is a necessary being and as such could be defined as the "uncaused cause" of everything else that exists.
As the gospel of John says <i>"1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 
3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made"</i>

### The True Vine
&nbsp;

So, why is this site called The True Vine and what's its relevance? It's a reference to John, chapter 15:

<pre><i>
    1 "I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. 2 He cuts off every branch in me that bears 
    no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes a so that it will be even more fruitful. 
    3 You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. 4 Remain in me, as I also remain 
    in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit 
    unless you remain in me. 5 "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, 
    you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. 6 If you do not remain in me, you are 
    like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and
    burned. 7 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done 
    for you. 8 This is to my Fatherâ€™s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my 
    disciples.
</i></pre>

This to me is the very heart of the Gospel. The Vine is a metaphor for the "Mystical Body of Christ".
What Jesus is trying to convey here is the importance of grace, which is basically divine life/energy.
