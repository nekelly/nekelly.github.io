### Fine Tuning Of The "Constants" Of Nature

- A large number of the constants of nature are finely tuned, some with incredible degrees of precision
- Science has been unable to explain the values assigned to the constants
- Examples of constants: strength of the strong/weak nuclear forces, mass of an electron
- The atoms required to make carbon-based lifeforms was created inside stars and star formation is very much
  dependent on fine-tuning. i.e. if the values of the constants were slightly different, we would not exist.
