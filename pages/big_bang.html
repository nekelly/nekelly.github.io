<h3>The Big Bang</h3>

		The entire universe began to exist 13.8 billion years ago. To speak of a time "before" the big-bang is meaningless becase
		time itself began with the big bang. Also space didn't exist "before" the Big Bang. 
		There was literally <strong>nothing</strong> at all!
		</p>
		<p>
		If space, time, matter and energy began to exist, it stands to reason that the cause of the Big Bang cannot be something
		physical/natural. Therefore whatever caused the big-bang is timeless, spaceless and immensely powerful.	Philosophers and
		theologians call this cause God.

		The size of the universe is beyond human imagination. Our sun is one small star among the approximately 100 million stars in
		the Milky Way galaxy. It is estimated that there are also approximately 100 million galaxies. The diameter of the entire universe
		is 880,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kms across! This begs the question, if God created the universe, why is it so big and so old?
		</p>
		<p>
		The reason for the size and the age of the universe is that it's goverened by the laws of physics. For life to exist, carbon and other
		essential elements must exist. Since these elements are formed in the nuclear furnaces inside stars, the time for life to appear in the
		universe depends on the time it takes for massive stars to form, to go through their natural life-cycle and end in massive explosions,
		scattering elements like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen across the universe. This matter eventually formed planets suitable for life.
		Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old so it has been around for about 1/3 of the history of universe.
