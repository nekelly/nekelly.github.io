### Meaning and Purpose
&nbsp;

If we hold the view that there exist nothing other than matter and energy (materialism), then it stands to reason that life on this
planet of ours can have no objective purpose and meaning. According to science, the first simple lifeforms come to be through the 
random chemical reactions that occurred in the "primordial soup". According to ne0-darwinian evolution, random (DNA) mutation and 
natural selection combined to produce the higher species (animals and humans).
