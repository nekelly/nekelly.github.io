<p><i>John 15:1 "I am the True Vine"</i></p>

	    This purpose of this website is to present arguments in support of the following claims:
	</p>
	<p>
	    <ul>
		<li>Atheism is irrational and self-defeating</li>
		<li>Belief in God is rational</li>
		<li>Christianity is the only true religion</li>
	    </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	    The arguments are drawn from science (cosmology, physics, biology) and philosophy.
	    These arguments are not intended to be exhaustive but rather a starting point for the interested reader to
	    further explore them in depth. The "books" section gives recommendations for further reading.
