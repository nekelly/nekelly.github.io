        <p>Hello and welcome to my apologetics site. My hope is that the material presented in these pages might offer the reader
		   some new ideas that he or she may not have come across before. I hope at the very least, it will provide some food for thought</p>
		
		<p>The purpose of this site is to attempt to show that belief in God
		   is not necessarily a matter of blind faith, as most of us have been often told. Rather, belief in a Supreme Being
		   is not only rational, but is the only way to make sense of the world we live in. Science by its very nature is 
		   constrained to observe nothing but natural phenomema. While this approach is understandable from a scientific point of view, 
		   it is ultimately self-defeating. My personal belief is that fundamental science has just about pushed the boundaries of science
		   as far at they can go and has such, has hit a "glass ceiling". This is propably most evident in the fields of particle physics
		   and cosmology where scientist are desperately trying to solve the problem of the origin of the universe and to unite
		   General Relativity and Quantum Physics. While the scientific observations corroborate General Theory and provide ample evidence
		   that the universe began to exist 13.8 billion years ago, the idea of a beginning from nothing is abhorrent to a large part of
		   the scientific community, who prefer eternal models of the universe in which there was no beginning.</p>
		<p>The second claim that I make here is that the world's various religions are fundamentally incompatible becuase they make
		   mutually-exclusive, contradictory claims. It is therefore logical to conclude that either, all religions are false or that one
		   and only one is true. For a religion to be true, it must be revealed by God since we cannot know God directly expect by God's
		   self-revelation. My claim is that Jesus is God's definitive self-revelation since Jesus was and is God-made-man i.e. one person
           with a divine and a human nature.</p>
        <p>My contention is that God is a necessary being and as such could be defined as the "uncaused cause" of everything else that exists.
		   As the gospel of John says <i>"1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 
		   3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made"</i></p>
